# 7000-series Backplane Breakout Board
## Version 1
This board brings out the most commonly used high speed signals out to BNC connectors, and low-speed or power signals to screw connectors.
The intent is to allow cables to be routed out the front of the scope for connection to external circuits or test equipment.

### Board Outline
This is a crude dimensioned drawing of the basic board outline for the V1 breakout board.
I make no apologies for the mixed units, the edge connector width is tied tightly to the 38-way 0.1" edge connector and the board width of 4.5".
All other dimensions were directly measured with a caliper from multiple 7000 plug-in modules.
Form, fit, and function have been validated with plug-in frames, including the rear plastic housing (e.g., Tek part number 386-1402-00.)

### Eagle Files
Schematic and board files for a 4-layer implementation.
Note that this does not include any indication for hard gold plating on the edge connector, or chamfering of the board edge.

### OSHpark Project

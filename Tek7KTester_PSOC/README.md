# Tek7KTesters_PSOC

This subdirectory contains the PSoC creator files to instantiate the PSOC solution that drives the tester.

TODO:
* Figure out how to specify relative files, the paths in many of the PSoC Creator files are currently absolute, making this git repo something wildly less than portable. Currently this subdirectory needs to be spoon-fed to PSoC Creator.
* Trim the content held in git as much as possible, forcing PCoC Creator to regenerate files it can as needed.
* Tune the .gitignore file to ensure we don't pick up cruft.
* Correctly set up Debug/Release builds.
* Verified to work with PSoC Creator 4.4
